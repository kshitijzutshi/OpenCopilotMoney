## Analytics Dashboard Overview

The analytics dashboard gives you a comprehensive view of your financial health. Access your [dashboard](/dashboard) to follow along with these examples:

### Real-time Metrics

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Savings Rate

Monitor your savings rate to understand your wealth-building efficiency:

```typescript
interface SavingsRate {
  totalIncome: number;
  totalExpenses: number;
  savingsRate: number; // (income - expenses) / income * 100
}

const calculateSavingsRate = (income: number, expenses: number): number => {
  return income > 0 ? ((income - expenses) / income) * 100 : 0;
};
```

Understanding spending by category helps identify areas for optimization:
